<!--HTML stands for hypertext markup language
HTML is the foundation of every webstie, used to organize and structure content on the browser

The first line (<!DOCTYPE html>) tells the browser about the type of document and that it uses HTML5.
The <html lang="en"> tag defines the language of the webpage content — in this case, English.

The <head> tag contains meta information about the webpage.
This includes:
the title of the webpage (shown in the browser tab),
stylesheets (CSS files),
scripts (like JavaScript),
and metadata (like author, description, keywords, etc.).

✨ Note: Everything inside the <head> is not visible to the user on the webpage.

The <body> tag contains the actual content of the webpage that is visible to users, such as:
text,
images,
buttons,
videos,
and anything interactive or displayed on the screen.-->
